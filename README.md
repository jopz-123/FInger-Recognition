# Finger-Recognition

Most fingerprint biometric solutions look for specific features of a fingerprint, such as the ridge line patterns on the finger, the valleys between the ridges, etc., commonly known as minutiae, which are then converted to stored digital data. 
In order to get a fingerprint match for verification or authorization, biometric systems must find a sufficient number of minutiae patterns.
This number varies across systems.
Although fingerprint identifier verification has become a popular and efficient security technology, 
most of fingerprint recognition systems are vulnerable to various threats, such as attacks at the sensor level or at the database level.



Steps to follow in order to work A.I Voice Recognition :-

->Install python latest version

->install visual studio code

->Import all the  files for the voice recognition like:-

import cv2
import time
import os
import HandTrackingModule as htm

->Once installation of codes subsequnently, run the codes.
